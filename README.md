# EduWise â€“ E-Learning Platform (Frontend)

A full-featured e-learning web app where users can enroll in courses, watch lectures, solve quizzes, earn certificates, and become instructors.

## âœ… Why I Built This
This was my **Software Engineering term project** and also my **first large full-stack project after my internship**  â€” more than 25,000 lines of code. I built it to learn how real-world platforms work: authentication, dashboards, media uploads, role-based access, certificate generation, and more.  
It became the best project in my class.
